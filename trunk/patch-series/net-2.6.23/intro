CAN: Add new PF_CAN protocol family, try #4
ESUBJECT

Hello Dave,

this is the fourth post of the patch series that adds the PF_CAN
protocol family for the Controller Area Network.

Since our last post we have changed the following:

* Revert our change to use skb->iif instead of skb->cb.  After
  discussion with Patrick and Jamal it turned out, our first
  implementation was correct.
 
* Change vcan network driver to use the new RTNL API.

* Use skb_tail_pointer() instead of skb->tail directly.

* Minor changes for 64-bit-cleanliness.

* Minor cleanup of #include's

This patch series applies against net-2.6.23 and is derived from Subversion
revision r422 of http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan.
It can be found in the directory
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/patch-series/<version>.

This patch doesn't touch anything in the kernel except for the allocation
of a couple of numbers for protocol, arp hw type, and a line discipline.

Please consider this patch series for integration into your tree.

Thanks very much for your work!

Best regards,

Urs Thuermann
Oliver Hartkopp
