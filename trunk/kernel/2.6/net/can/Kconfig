menuconfig CAN
	depends on NET
	tristate "CAN bus subsystem support"
	---help---
	  Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial
	  communications protocol was developed by Bosch at 1991 mainly for
	  automotive, but now widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial and
	  medical applications.
	  More information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/can/>.

	  If you want CAN support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your controller(s) below.

	  This CAN support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called can-core.

config CAN_RAW
	tristate "Raw CAN Protocol"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  The Raw CAN protocol option offers access to the CAN bus via
	  the BSD socket API. You probably want to use the raw socket in
	  most cases where no higher level protocol is being used. To
	  send raw CAN packets, use AF_CAN and CAN_PROTO_RAW.

config CAN_BCM
	tristate "Broadcast Manager (BCM) for LLCF"
	depends on CAN
	default N


config CAN_DEBUG_CORE
       bool "CAN Core debugging messages"
       depends on CAN
       help
         Say Y here if you want the CAN core to produce a bunch of debug
         messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having a
         problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going on.
