menuconfig CAN
	depends on NET
	tristate "CAN bus subsystem support"
	---help---
	  Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial
	  communications protocol was developed by Bosch at 1991 mainly for
	  automotive, but now widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial and
	  medical applications.
	  More information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/can/>.

	  If you want CAN support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your controller(s) below.

	  This CAN support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called can.ko.

config CAN_RAW
	tristate "Raw CAN Protocol"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  The Raw CAN protocol option offers access to the CAN bus via
	  the BSD socket API. You probably want to use the raw socket in
	  most cases where no higher level protocol is being used. The raw 
	  socket has several filter options e.g. ID-Masking / Errorframes.
	  To receive/send raw CAN messages, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_RAW.

config CAN_RAW_USER
	bool "Allow non-root users to access Raw CAN Protocol sockets"
	depends on CAN_RAW
	default N
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want non-root users to be able to access CAN_RAW-
	  sockets. This may lead to a security hole.

config CAN_BCM
	tristate "Broadcast Manager (BCM)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  The Broadcast Manager offers content filtering, timeout monitoring,
	  sending of RTR-frames and cyclic CAN messages without permanent user
	  interaction. The BCM can be 'programmed' via the BSD socket API and
	  informs you on demand e.g. only on content updates / timeouts.
	  You probably want to use the bcm socket in most cases where cyclic
	  CAN messages are used on the bus (e.g. in automotive environments).
	  To use the Broadcast Manager, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_BCM.

config CAN_BCM_USER
	bool "Allow non-root users to access CAN broadcast manager sockets"
	depends on CAN_BCM
	default N
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want non-root users to be able to access CAN_BCM-
	  sockets. This may lead to a security hole.

config CAN_DEBUG_CORE
       bool "CAN Core debugging messages"
       depends on CAN
       ---help---
         Say Y here if you want the CAN core to produce a bunch of debug
         messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having a
         problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going on.
