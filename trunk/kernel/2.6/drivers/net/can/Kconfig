config CAN_VCAN
	tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
	  virtual local CAN interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called vcan.

config CAN_SLCAN
	tristate "Serial / USB serial CAN Adaptors (slcan)"
	depends on CAN && EXPERIMENTAL
	default N
	---help---
	  CAN driver for several 'low cost' CAN interfaces that are attached
	  via serial lines or via USB-to-serial adapters using the LAWICEL
	  ASCII protocol. The driver implements the tty linediscipline N_SLCAN.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called slcan.

config CAN_OLD_DRIVERS
	tristate "Prompt for old CAN drivers (e.g. no sysfs support)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  The old drivers do not support sysfs nor proper platform device
	  support. Some of the old drivers might only be configured by
	  module commandline options.

source "drivers/net/can/old/Kconfig"

config CAN_DEV
	tristate "Platform CAN drivers with Netlink support"
	depends on CAN
	default Y
	---help---
	  Enables the common framework for platform CAN drivers with Netlink
	  support. This is the standard library for CAN drivers.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_DEV_SYSFS
	bool "Support for sysfs interface (deprecated)"
	depends on CAN_DEV && SYSFS
	default N
	---help---
	  Adds support for the legacy sysfs interface to configure CAN
	  devices. If possible, please use the new netlink interface
	  instead.
	  If unsure, say N.

config CAN_CALC_BITTIMING
	bool "CAN bit-timing calculation"
	depends on CAN_DEV
	default Y
	---help---
	  If enabled, CAN bit-timing parameters will be calculated for the
	  bit-rate specified via Netlink argument "bitrate" when the device
	  get started. This works fine for the most common CAN controllers
	  with standard bit-rates but may fail for exotic bit-rates or CAN
	  source clock frequencies. Disabling saves some space, but then the
	  bit-timing parameters must be specified directly using the Netlink
	  arguments "tq", "prop_seg", "phase_seg1", "phase_seg2" and "sjw".
	  If unsure, say Y.
