config CAN_VCAN
       tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
       depends on CAN
       default N
       ---help---
         Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
         virtual local CAN interface.

config CAN_DEBUG_DEVICES
	bool "CAN devices debugging messages"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	 Say Y here if you want the CAN device drivers to produce a bunch of
	 debug messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having
	 a problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going
	 on.

config CAN_SJA1000
	depends on CAN
	tristate "Philips SJA1000"
	help
	  The SJA1000 is one of the top CAN controllers out there. As it
	  has a multiplexed interface it fits directly to 8051
	  microcontrollers, but not to today's memory mapped System on
	  Chip processors. You probably need a bus driver (see below)
	  which handles how to access your chip registers.

config CAN_MSCAN
       depends on CAN && (PPC || M68K || M68KNOMMU)
       tristate "Support for a Freescale MSCAN based chips"
       ---help---
        The Motorola Scalable Controller Area Network (MSCAN) definition
        is based on the MSCAN12 definition which is the specific
        implementation of the Motorola Scalable CAN concept targeted for
        the Motorola MC68HC12 Microcontroller Family.

config CAN_MPC52XX
       tristate "Freescale MPC5200 onboard CAN controller"
       depends on CAN_MSCAN && (PPC_MPC52xx || PPC_52xx)
       default LITE5200
       ---help---
        If you say yes here you get support for Freescale MPC5200
        onboard dualCAN controller.

        This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
        will be called mpc52xx_can.
