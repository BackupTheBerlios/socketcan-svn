config CAN_VCAN
	tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
	  virtual local CAN interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called vcan.

config CAN_SLCAN
	tristate "Serial / USB serial CAN Adaptors (slcan)"
	depends on CAN && EXPERIMENTAL
	default N
	---help---
	  CAN driver for several 'low cost' CAN interfaces that are attached
	  via serial lines or via USB-to-serial adapters using the LAWICEL
	  ASCII protocol. The driver implements the tty linediscipline N_SLCAN.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called slcan.

config CAN_OLD_DRIVERS
	tristate "Prompt for old CAN drivers (e.g. no sysfs support)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  The old drivers do not support sysfs nor proper platform device
	  support. Some of the old drivers might only be configured by
	  module commandline options.

if CAN_OLD_DRIVERS
source "drivers/net/can/old/Kconfig"

config CAN_DEV
	tristate "Prompt for platform CAN drivers with sysfs support"
	depends on CAN
	default Y
	---help---
	  Enables the common framework for platform CAN drivers with sysfs
	  support. This is the standard library for CAN drivers.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_CALC_BITTIMING
	bool "CAN bit-timing calculation"
	depends on CAN_DEV
	default Y
	---help---
	  If enabled, CAN bit-timing parameters will be calculated for the
	  bit-rate specified via SYSFS file "bitrate" when the device gets
	  started. This works fine for the most common CAN controllers
	  with standard bit-rates but may fail for exotic bit-rates or CAN
	  source clock frequencies. Disabling saves some space, but then the
	  bit-timing parameters must be specified directly using the SYSFS
	  files "tq", "prop_seg", "phase_seg1", "phase_seg2" and "sjw".
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_SJA1000
	depends on CAN_DEV
	tristate "Philips SJA1000"
	---help---
	  The SJA1000 is one of the top CAN controllers out there. As it
	  has a multiplexed interface it fits directly to 8051
	  microcontrollers or into the PC I/O port space. The SJA1000
	  is a full CAN controller, with shadow registers for RX and TX.
	  It can send and receive any kinds of CAN frames (SFF/EFF/RTR)
	  with a single (simple) filter setup.

	  This driver will use the new device interface.

config CAN_SJA1000_PLATFORM
	depends on CAN_SJA1000
	tristate "generic Platform Bus based SJA1000 driver"
	---help---
	  This driver adds support for the SJA1000 chips connected to
	  the "platform bus" (Linux abstraction for directly to the
	  processor attached devices).	Which can be found on various
	  boards from Phytec (http://www.phytec.de) like the PCM027,
	  PCM038.

config CAN_EMS_PCI
	tristate "EMS CPC-PCI and CPC-PCIe Card"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the one or two channel CPC-PCI and CPC-PCIe
	  cards from EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche (http://www.ems-wuensche.de).

config CAN_EMS_PCMCIA
	tristate "EMS CPC-CARD Card"
	depends on PCMCIA && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the one or two channel CPC-CARD cards from
	  EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche (http://www.ems-wuensche.de).

config CAN_IXXAT_PCI
	tristate "IXXAT PCI Card"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the IXXAT PC-I 04/PCI card (1 or 2 channel)
	  from the IXXAT Automation GmbH (http://www.ixxat.de).

config CAN_PEAK_PCI
	tristate "PEAK PCAN PCI Card"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the PCAN PCI, the PC-PCI CAN plug-in card (1 or
	  2 channel) from PEAK Systems (http://www.peak-system.com).

config CAN_PIPCAN
	depends on CAN_SJA1000
	tristate "MPL PIPCAN CAN module driver (SJA1000)"
	---help---
	  This driver adds support for the PIPCAN module used on some SBC
	  boards from MPL AG (http://www.mpl.ch).

config CAN_KVASER_PCI
	tristate "Kvaser PCIcanx and Kvaser PCIcan PCI Cards"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the the PCIcanx and PCIcan cards (1, 2 or
	  4 channel) from Kvaser (http://www.kvaser.com).

config CAN_SOFTING

	tristate "Support for a Freescale MSCAN based chips"
	---help---
	  The Motorola Scalable Controller Area Network (MSCAN) definition
	  is based on the MSCAN12 definition which is the specific
	  implementation of the Motorola Scalable CAN concept targeted for
	  the Motorola MC68HC12 Microcontroller Family.

config CAN_MPC52XX
	tristate "Freescale MPC5200 onboard CAN controller"
	depends on CAN_MSCAN && (PPC_MPC52xx || PPC_52xx)
	default LITE5200
	---help---
	  If you say yes here you get support for Freescale MPC5200
	  onboard dualCAN controller.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called mpc52xx_can.

config CAN_MCP251X
	tristate "Microchip MCP251x SPI CAN controllers"
	depends on CAN_DEV && SPI
	---help---
	  Driver for the Microchip MCP251x SPI CAN controllers.

config CAN_DEBUG_DEVICES
	bool "CAN devices debugging messages"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want the CAN device drivers to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having
	  a problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going
	  on.
